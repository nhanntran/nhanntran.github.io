excerpt: 'Abstract: I study the effects of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) on labor market outcomes among potentially eligible immigrants. Using a regression discontinuity design,  I find very little to no effects on the probability of working. Furthermore, I find no effect on wage income or the probability of working in high-skilled jobs. The estimates in this paper suggest that temporary legal status has limited effects for the older group of DACA-eligible individuals.'
