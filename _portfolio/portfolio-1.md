title: "The effects of DACA on health insurance among undocumented immigrants and US-born children"
excerpt: "Abstract: This paper examines the effect of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program on health coverage among non-citizen immigrants and their US-born children. I exploit the regression discontinuity design that utilizes the individualâ€™s age in 2012 with data drawn from the American Community Survey. I find that DACA eligibility among likely DACA mothers increase Medicaid insurance among US-born children by approximately 4 percentage points. However, DACA eligibility do not increase health coverage likely DACA recipients."
